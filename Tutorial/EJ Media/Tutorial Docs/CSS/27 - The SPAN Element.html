 <h2> This is a section on Bass Fish. </h2>

 <p class="p2"> Bass Fish live in lakes. The word for fish in Latin is 
 <i>Pisces</i>. </p>

 <p class="p3"> Fish are gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs
 with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the
 olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and
 cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. 
 Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as 
 well. However, traditionally fish are rendered paraphyletic by excluding the 
 tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all 
 descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term 
 "fish" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a 
 formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology, unless it is used in the 
 cladistic sense, including tetrapods. The traditional term pisces (also 
 ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification.
