know about fish is in this web site. </p>

<h2> This is a section on Bass Fish. </h2>

<p class="p2"> Bass Fish live in lakes. The word for fish in Latin is 
<i>Pisces</i>. </p>

<p class="p3"> Fish are gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs
with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the
olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and
cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. 
Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as 
well. However, traditionally fish are rendered paraphyletic by excluding the 
tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all 
descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term 
"fish" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a 
formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology, unless it is used in the 
cladistic sense, including tetrapods. The traditional term pisces (also 
ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification.
