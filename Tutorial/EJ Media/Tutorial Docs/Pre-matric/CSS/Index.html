<h2> This is a section on Bass fish. </h2>

<p class="paragraph"> Bass fish live in lakes. The word for fish in Latin is
<em>pisces</em>. </p>

<p class="paragraph"> A fish is any member of a paraphyletic group of organisms that
consists of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with
digits. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and
cartilaginous and bony fish, as well as various extinct related groups. Most
fish are ectothermic ("cold-blooded"), allowing their body temperatures to vary
as ambient temperatures change, though some of the large active swimmers like
white shark and tuna that can hold a higher core temperature. Fish are abundant
in most bodies of water. They can be found in nearly all aquatic environments,
from high mountain streams (e.g. char and gudgeon) to the abyssal and even
hadal depths of the deepest oceans (e.g. gulpers and anglerfish). At 32,000
species, fish ehibit greater species diversity than any other group of
vertebrates. </p>
