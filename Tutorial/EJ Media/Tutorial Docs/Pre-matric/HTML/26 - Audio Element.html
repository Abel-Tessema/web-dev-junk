<i>[J. Cole:]</i><br>
This one's for you<br>
This one's for you<br>
<i>[Bas:]</i><br>
I think I made it<br>
<br>
I think I made it, I think I made it<br>
'Cause I'm always smiling, and you are the reason now<br>
Girl, I can't explain it<br>
It's all in the timing, I had to get low<br>
I had to get low<br>
I had to get back, I had to report<br>
I had to get facts 'cause you are just that, you that<br>
Girl, you share your truths with me<br>
And I find them true, amused, you in the booth with me<br>
<br>
Can't spoil time on nickeling and diming<br>
I got me a girl, she don't want no diamonds<br>
A daily reminder to holler at God<br>
Like where did you find her? Good looking, my nigga<br>
Everything around me I took it<br>
Did it with only the niggas I knew<br>
And a few niggas I thought I knew better<br>
There go my bitches, I always do better<br>
But, you're more top echelon<br>
My next probably be a step backwards<br>
Niggas front when they get struck with love<br>
Like in drama, they used to be the best actors<br>
I'm done with all that tough acting<br>
John Madden when I saw it happen, and so it happens<br>
My niggas want life's good things, they still dreaming<br>
And you deserve them too, I'ma do it just so it happens<br>
<br>
I think I made it, I think I made it<br>
'Cause I'm always smiling, and you are the reason now<br>
Girl, I can't explain it<br>
It's all in the timing, I had to get low, I had to get low<br>
I had to get back, I had to report<br>
I had to get facts 'cause you are just that, you that<br>
You share your truths with me<br>
And I find them true, amused, you in the booth with me<br>

La, la, la, la, la<br>
La, la, la, la, la (this one's for you)<br>
La, la, la, la, la<br>
La, la, la, la, la (this one's for you)<br>
La, la, la, la, la<br>
La, la, la, la, la (I'm hella faded)<br>
La, la, la, la, la (yeah)<br>
La, la, la, la, la<br>
<br>
I'm hella faded, I'm hella faded<br>
These niggas been hating, I don't know the reason now<br>
Sometimes I feel jaded<br>
They don't see the real me<br>
They only know Cole, they only know Co-ole<br>
I had to get back, I had to resort to turning my back<br>
I'm doing just that, true that<br>
I thought He was through with me, but that wasn't true<br>
The proof? You in the coupe with me<br>
God shuffled the cards, dealt me a hand with impossible odds<br>
Put an obstacle course up<br>
Look, and I conquered them all (conquered them all)<br>
With minimal effort I'm fresher than sock in your drawer (fuck)<br>
They spinning my records so heavy, I'm topping the Forbes<br>
Stuck in a rock in a hard place though<br>
Is it true what they say? The higher you go, the longer the fall?<br>
Well I dropped to the floor then knocking the door was on queue<br>
I thought that I saw it all 'til I saw you<br>
Now I call you when the sun shines and the rain dries up<br>
I'm a pit bull, but for you I be on chain tied up (one more time)<br>
In the backyard with a muzzle on tail wagging like Oregon Trail<br>
Waiting on you to come through just like you do, well...<br>
