  <a name="Birds">
Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the 
class Aves /'e?vi?z/, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, 
the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart,
 and a strong yet lightweight skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in
 size from the 5.5 cm (2.2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.8 m 
(9 ft 2 in) ostrich. There are about ten thousand living species,
 more than half of which are passerine, or "perching" birds. Birds
 have wings whose development varies according to species; the only
 known groups without wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds. Wings, 
which evolved from forelimbs, gave birds the ability to fly, although
 further evolution has led to the loss of flight in some birds, including 
ratites, penguins, and diverse endemic island species. The digestive and 
respiratory systems of birds are also uniquely adapted for flight. Some 
bird species of aquatic environments, particularly seabirds and some 
waterbirds, have further evolved for swimming.

  <a name="Ducks"> 
The oldest known paravian (and probably the earliest avialan) fossils 
come from the Tiaojishan Formation of China, which has been dated to
 the late Jurassic period (Oxfordian stage), about 160 million
 years ago. The avialan species from this time period include Anchiornis
 huxleyi, Xiaotingia zhengi, and Aurornis xui.[12]
