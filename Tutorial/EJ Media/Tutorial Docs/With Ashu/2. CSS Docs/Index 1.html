<p class="p3"> The earliest organisms that can be classified as fish were
soft-bodied chordates that first appeared during the Cambrian period.
Although they lacked a true spine, they possessed notochords which allowed
them to be more agile than their invertebrate counterparts. Fish would
continue to evolve through the Paleozoic era, diversifying into a wide
variety of forms. Many fish of the Paleozoic developed external armor
that protected them from predators. The first fish with jaws appeared in
the Silurian period, after which many (such as sharks) became formidable
marine predators rather than just the prey of <span style="background-color:
