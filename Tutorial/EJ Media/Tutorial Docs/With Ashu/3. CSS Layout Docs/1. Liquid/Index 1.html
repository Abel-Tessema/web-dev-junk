<h1> The Battle of Adwa </h1>

<p>

In 1889, the Italians signed the Treaty of Wuchale with then King Menelik
of the Ethiopian Empire. The treaty ceded territories previously part of
Ethiopia, namely the provinces of Bogos, Hamasien, Akele Guzai, Serae, and
parts of Tigray. In return, Italy promised Menelik II, now emperor,
continued rule, financial assistance and military supplies. A dispute later
arose over the interpretation of the two versions of the document. The
Italian-language version of the disputed Article 17 of the treaty stated
that the Emperor of Ethiopia was obliged to conduct all foreign affairs
through Italian authorities, effectively making Ethiopia a protectorate of
the Kingdom of Italy. The Amharic version of the article, however, stated
that the Emperor could use the good offices of the Kingdom of Italy in his
relations with foreign nations if he wished. However, the Italian diplomats
claimed that the original Amharic text included the clause and that Menelik
II knowingly signed a modified copy of the Treaty.

<h1> Order of Battle </h1>

<p>

Estimates for the Ethiopian forces under Menelik range from a low of
73,000 to a high of over 120,000, outnumbering the Italians by an
estimated five or six times. The forces were divided among Emperor
Menelik, Empress Taytu Betul, Ras Wale Betul, Ras Mengesha Atikem, Ras
Mengesha Yohannes, Ras Alula Engida (Abba Nega), Ras Mikael of Wollo, Ras
Makonnen Wolde Mikael,Fitawrari Habte Giyorgis, Fitawrari Gebeyyehu,
and Negus Tekle Haymanot Tessemma. In addition, the armies were
followed by a similar number of camp followers who supplied the army, as
had been done for centuries. Most of the army consisted of riflemen,
a significant percentage of whom were in Menelik's reserve; however, there
were also a significant number of cavalry and infantry only armed with
lances (those with lances were referred to as "lancer servants"). The
Kuban Cossack army officer N. S. Leontiev who visited Ethiopia in 1895,
according to some sources, led a small team of Russian advisers and
volunteers. Other sources assert that Leontiev did not in fact
participate in the battle, rather he visited Ethiopia first unofficially
in January 1895, and then officially as a representative of Russia in
August 1895, but then left later that year, returning only after the
Battle of Adwa.

<h1> Immediate Aftermath </h1>

<p>

The Italians suffered about 6,000 killed and 1,500 wounded in the battle
and subsequent retreat back into Eritrea, with 3,000 taken prisoner.
Brigadiers Dabormida and Arimondi were amongst the dead. Ethiopian losses
have been estimated at around 4,000–5,000 killed and 8,000 wounded. In
their flight to Eritrea, the Italians left behind all of their artillery
and 11,000 rifles, as well as most of their transport.

</p>

<p>

As Paul B. Henze
notes, "Baratieri's army had been completely annihilated while Menelik's
was intact as a fighting force and gained thousands of rifles and a great
deal of equipment from the fleeing Italians." The 3,000 Italian prisoners,
who included Brigadier Albertone, appear to have been treated as well as
could be expected under difficult circumstances, though about 200 died of
their wounds in captivity.
