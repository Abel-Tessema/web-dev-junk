<h2> I AM A FIRM BELIEVER IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF POSITIVE THINKING, AND IT WAS A GREAT SHOCK TO HEAR YOU SPEAK AGAINST MOTHER TERESA AND HER PHILOSOPHY OF POSITIVE THINKING. </h2>

<p>

I am pleased that at least someone was listening, someone was awake, someone was not asleep. This is what positive philosophy is: you are shocked and I am happy! <br> <br>

But I am not a believer in anything at all. <br> <br>

Belief as such is against my way of looking at things. <br> <br>

Belief is a blind man’s groping in the dark. I do not believe in anything, I do not disbelieve in anything – because both are belief systems. Either I know or I don’t know. I am absolutely clear about it. <br> <br>

You are saying that you are a "firm believer". What does it mean? A firm believer – why have you used the word "firm"? There must be some infirmity hiding behind it. Is not just being a believer enough? You know it is not; hence you have to add something more, make it more solid, more strong. But whatever you do, a belief is a belief, and can never become knowing. Your firm believing simply proves that your doubting is very firm. A firm doubter needs a firm believing. An ordinary doubter simply believes. <br> <br>
