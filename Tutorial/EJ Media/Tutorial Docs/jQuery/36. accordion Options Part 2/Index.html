	<h2> Something to Ponder Over... </h2>
	
		<p>
		
			Our lives are limited. <br>
			The focus is on how much time it takes to make a decision... <br>
			In other words, the important thing is how quickly you can think.
			
		</p>
		
	<h2> Hence the Lesson... </h2>
	
		<p>
			
			Don't overthink things. <br>
			In my experience, people who are absorbed in their thoughts are just as easy to fool as people who don't think at all. <br>
			Think in moderation, act in moderation. <br>
			That's the lesson for you here.
